# Rickless Adventures with Morty CLI
Based on characters and dimensions from Rick and Morty, Rickless Adventures with Morty CLI is a Ruby based command line interface game.

# Gameplay
- Join Morty's adventure to fill up his Mortydex by traveling to different planets by using Rick's portal gun.
- Try to collect as many aliens as you can!
- Not all aliens want to be a part of the Mortydex so if you piss one off, you'll have to run away to another planet!
- You'll have a limited amount of portal gun charges so try to build up your Mortydex and get as many points as you can before your charges run out.
